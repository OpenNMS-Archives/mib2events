BUILDING RPMs
-------------

You should be able to build the mib2events binary tarball directly:

  rpmbuild -tb mib2events*.tar.gz

BUILDING DEBs
-------------

Since this is a such a simple package, we have provided an "equivs" control
file.  Just run:

  apt-get install equivs
  equivs-build mib2events.equivs

RUNNING
-------

If you are running the binary distribution directly, just run:

  java -jar lib/mib2events.jar --help

If you are using RPM or Debian packages, there should be a "mib2events" script
in /usr/bin that works the same way.
